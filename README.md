# wale - Web Accessible Libraries Engine

## Purpose

The goal of this project was just to learn more about Azure Functions.

## Details

The WebAccessibleLibrary project is what runs in Azure Functions. There is a web api, WaleApi, that exposes these functions, and a Library that has code to call the Azure Functions.

## Future Improvements
- Add more CPU intensive functions
- Allow a user to specify they want performance metrics returned with their results - could be interesting to see how performant Azure Functions are
- Add functions in different languages
